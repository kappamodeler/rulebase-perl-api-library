=head1 NAME

Cellucidate - Perl extension for blah blah blah

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Cellucidate;

  # Search for a bookshelf, returns an array of bookshelf hashes
  $bookshelves = Cellucidate::Bookshelf->find();
  $bookshelves = Cellucidate::Bookshelf->find( { name => 'Reference 10' });

  # Single bookshelf
  $bookshelf = Cellucidate::Bookshelf->show(102);

  # Bookshelf properties
  $bookshelf->{id}   # => 102
  $bookshelf->{name} # => 'Reference 10'


  # Search for books
  $books = Cellucidate::Bookshelf->find();
  $bookshelf->books();


  # Single book  

  # Search for models
  $models = Cellucidate::Model->find( ... );

  # Single model
  $model = Cellucidate::Model->show( id );

  $model->model_rules();

  model_id => $model->{id}

  # Single model_rules
  $model_rules = Cellucidate::ModelRule->show( id );


  # Simulation Run
  
  $params = {
    "num_iterations" => 3
  };

  $simulation_run = Cellucidate::SimulationRun->create($params);
  
  $simulation_run->{state}; #is it still running?

  $plots = $simulation_run->plots();  # Cellucidate::Plot->find( { simulation_run_id => $id } );

  /plots/1 (/plots1.xml) => metadata
  /plots/1.csv => Dump of CSV data


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Stub documentation for Cellucidate, created by h2xs. It looks like the
author of the extension was negligent enough to leave the stub
unedited.

Blah blah blah.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
